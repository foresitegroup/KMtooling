    Specializing in molded rubber injection, compression, and transfer tooling, along with open cast and compression polyurethane tooling, KM Tooling supports thermoset elastomer molders with modern, high quality mold design and construction, mold revisions, and mold repairs.  Our experienced team provides design for manufacturability assistance to ensure a robust part design, an efficient molding process, and a durable tool for the life of the project. Molded rubber and cast polyurethane tools, designed and programmed in our resource center, are manufactured using up-to-date, well-maintained equipment in our tool factory.<br>
    <br>

    <h3>Rubber: Injection, Compression, Transfer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tools range in size to 30"</li>

    Cold forming dies, also known as cold forging dies, are often used to manufacture lead parts consumed by the medical industry as shielding and by the aircraft industry as counterweights and ballasts.  The formed lead parts meet critical functional specifications without compromise to design for manufacture (DFM), design for assembly (DFA), quality and cost.<br>
    <br>

    <h3>Cold Forming (Cold Forging) Dies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dies range in size to 24"</li>
      <li>Construction Materials: Cast Iron, Carbon Steel</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    Prepping fixtures, insert loading, inspection jigs and assembly devices, reduce the nonproductive time of any mass production process. They are designed and constructed with operator ergonomics and ease of use in mind.<br>

    <h2 id="metallic-non-metallic-dies">Metallic &amp; Non-Metallic Dies</h2>
    Die casting trim dies are one of the most effective ways to trim unwanted "flash" from cast metal parts, saving as much as 15% in the part price by speeding up the die casting production process.  KM Tooling designers focus both on part and die optimization, improving finished part quality and reducing material usage and cycle times.  Our process begins with engineering input to design a part for efficient flash removal and includes functional testing as a standard part of our die design and manufacturing process.<br>
    <br>

    <h3>Casting Trim Dies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trim Die Design, Manufacture, and Maintenance</li>
      <li>Dies range in size to 24"</li>
      <li>Construction Materials: Hardened Tool Steel</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    Dies used for cutting non-metallic product such as paper, adhesive sheet, laminated board, polyester film and plastic sheet are used in a variety of industries in many applications.  Some product examples include plastic food packaging and electrical insulation used in motors.<br>
    <br>

    <h3>Non-Metallic Cutting Dies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cutting Die Design, Manufacture, and Maintenance</li>
      <li>Dies range in size to 24"</li>
      <li>Construction Materials: Hardened Tool Steel</li>
    </ul>
